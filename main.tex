\section{Introduction}
The brain's visual system translates ambiguous and rapidly-changing patterns of light falling on the retina into a coherent representation of the external world that can be used to guide behavior. The ability to recognize objects despite the enormous variation with which they can appear, \textit{e.g.}, due to viewing angle, scale, or lighting, is called invariant object recognition. The hierarchical organization of sensory cortex is thought to play a key role in its ability to extract and learn about latent structure from visual inputs. For example, visual object recognition in primates is thought to emerge through sequential processing across cortical areas in the ventral visual pathway~\cite{rustselectivity2010, DiCarlo:2007aa, dicarlo2012does, Chen2014682}, and numerous studies show increasing selectivity for complex stimuli at progressively higher levels of a sensory processing hierarchy~\cite{desimone1984stimulus, logothetis1996visual}.  However, the nature of the transformations that occur from one level of the hierarchy to the next remain poorly understood. 

Increasing evidence suggests rodents possess sophisticated visual machinery that would make them a tractable model for studying multi-level visual processing. Rats, in particular, can perform invariant object recognition tasks~\cite{cite, cite, cite}, and their visual cortex, namely, areas V1, LM, LI, and LL, exhibits properties similar to that of primates~\cite{cite, cite cite}. Here, we take advantage of optical methods, which allow simultaneous access to multiple brain regions with single-cell resolution, and present their first application to an animal model of invariant object recognition. We describe the macro- and micro-scale organization of V1, LM, and LI in the context of a range of stimulus classes. Specifically, we characterize feature tuning and object tuning in rat visual cortex to examine how neural circuits encode feature variations that either preserve object identity or alter object identity. 


\section{Retinotopic organization of rat visual cortex}
\label{sec:retinotopy}

\subsection{Receptive field properties in rat visual cortex}
See Figure \ref{fig:fig2}. Microscale retinotopy exhibits scatter. Rate of retinotopic change differs from V1 to Lm to Li. Slope of change reflects mirror reflections between visual areas. Receptive field sizes increase from V1 to Lm to Li.

\section{Feature tuning in rat visual cortex}
See Figure \ref{fig:fig3}. All visual areas exhibit axis selectivity, but LI cells show less axis selectivity. Direction selectivity is similar and low for all visual areas. Direction tuning is preserved across stimulus configurations if spatial frequency, size, and speed are varied. Tuning similarity is negatively correlated with spatial distance between cells for all visual areas, especially in LI.

\section{Object preference in rat visual cortex}
See Figure \ref{fig:fig4}. Diversity of response profiles for object stimuli. Subsets of cells exhibit similar profiles of tuning (see panel B). All visual areas contain information about morph and size, which can be decoded with simple linear regression. Cells are more correlated in V1 than in LI.

\section{Models of object classification}
See Figure \ref{fig:fig5}. Rats trained to classify two objects can spontaneously generalize performance to novel, untrained identity-preserving transformations (vary size and in-depth rotation). Rats also spontaneously generalize performacne to novel, untrained identity-altering transformations in a predictable manner (as mesured by psychometric curves). To test whether naive neural responses of V1, Lm, and Li populations contain sufficient information to replicate the classification behavior in animals, we trained linear classifiers on the same task given to the behaving rats. Rats presented with object images learn to classify those images into 1 of 2 classes by  choosing one side to identify object A, and the other side to identify object B. Similarly, we trained linear SVMs with neural responses to these same object images to classify the responses as belonging to object A or object B. We then test the classifiers on intermediate morphs, which the classifiers have never before seen. Linear SVMs trained on neural data recorded from naive, passive-viewing rats are able to perform this task. V1 populations seem to best replicate the response profile seen in behaving rats, under the conditions tested. (More permutations of size/morph generalization must be done).

\section{Methods}
\textbf{\textit{Headpost and cranial window implants}}

Headposts and cranial windows were implanted in naive rats (female Long Evans, 200-300g). Anesthetized with isofluorane in 100\% O2 (induction, 3-5\%; maintenance, 1.5-2\%) and placed on a heating pad (INFO) in a stereotaxic apparatus (INFO). Opthalmic ointment (Puralube) was applied to both eyes. For V1/Lm rats, heatposts were centered ~4.5-5 mm medial and 5-6 mm posterior to Bregma over the right hemisphere at 40 degrees. A 5-mm diameter craniotomy was performed at the center of the headpost, followed by a duratomy. Windows were stacks of seven 5 mm coverslips attached to one 5 or 7 mm coverslip, similar to~\cite{andermannsurgery, anotherone}. Coverslips were cured at least 24 hrs prior to surgery (UV-cured Norland Optical Adhesive 71).  Coverslip stacks were placed into the cranial window and sealed first with Vetbond (3M) followed by C&B Metabond (Parkell) to form a seal.  ...

\textbf{\textit{Viral injections}}

Injected 500nl of AAV9-GCaMP6f intracranially at 5-8 sites per rat. Mannitol and Fast-Green for spread and visualization during injections. Virus mixture injected at 20nl/min. Injection sites were 0.5-0.8mm apart. ...

\textbf{\textit{Epifluoresence imaging}}

Custom macrolens scope~\cite{GrinwaldMacro}. To identify the visual areas accessible in each window, we used epifluorescence calcium imaging to measure changes in responses to moving bar stimuli in lightly anesthetized mice. Include anesthesia details... A blue LED light source (LED info, Thor Labs) was used for excitation, and the green fluorescence was passed through a [filter info] emission filter and collected using [camera info].  Images (img size) were recorded using custom software (Python) at 25 Hz.

\textbf{\textit{Two-photon imaging}}

Lots to add here. Custom two-photon microscope, objective information and zoom, laser info, ...
FOV size and depths... Images were colleced at 44.65 frams/s, xx pixels/frame, using ScanImage (Matlab). 
Duration and structure of sessions, etc.

\subsection{Visual stimulation}

\textbf{\textit{Setup and stimuli}}

Monitor info...

To measure visual field coverage of each FOV, we presented a moving bar (2 degree width) at each cardinal direction~\cite{kalatsky2009}. To preserve the speed of the bar between azimuth and elevation conditions, the bar traversed the full extent of the monitor's width centered along the monitor's vertical extend (bar started and ended off screen). 12 cycles per trial, 3-4 trials per condition, 12-16 trials total. Bar presented at 0.13 or 0.24 cyc/s.

To estimate receptive field size and positions, we adapted a standard retinotopic mapping protocol~\cite{petreanuRF}. The screen was tiled into either 21x11 positions of 5 degrees or 11x6 positions of 10 degrees (see Suppl. Figure X). Drifting gratings (spatial frequency 0.25 Hz, speed 10 deg/s) were presented in square apertures of 5 degrees at each position, and pseudo-randomly switched between the 4 cardinal directions every 125 ms during the 500 ms stimulus presentation window. Each position was repeated 10 to 20 times. 

To measure visual feature tuning, we presented drifting gratings at 8 directions (0 to 315 degrees, steps of 45 degrees). Gratings were presented at either full screen or apertured, with the aperture size determined by the average receptive field size of the population recorded in previous  mapping sessions.  All directions were also presented at two spatial frequencies (0.5 and 0.1 Hz) to target the low and high end of known visual acuity levels~\cit{stuff}, and at two speeds (10 deg/s and 20 deg/s). This set of stimulus configurations resulted in 64 unique grating stimuli, which were repeated ~20 times in pseuedo-random order.

Objects. Behavior experiments, for current and previous paper~\cite{Zoccolan2009rats}. Morph stimuli were parametrically varied between the two anchor, default views of objects A and B using [details] (POVray). Each morph (7 intermediate morphs, plus 2 anchors) was presented at 5 different sizes (10-50 degrees, in 10 degree steps). For each size, mean luminance was measured with a photometer (INFO) to determine the levels needed to create full-screen controls matched for each size and object (see Suppl. Fig. X). This resulted in 50 unique object conditions, presented across ~30 repetitions each.

\textbf{\textit{Retinotopic scatter}}

\subsection{Estimating tuning preferences in cells}

\textbf{\textit{Estimation of cells with significant visual responses}}

(Multiple methods so far, describing current):  For each cell and each stimulus condition, we determined the evoked response to be significantly different from noise if the amplitude of dF/F during the stimulus period exceeded 2.5 standard deviations above or below the mean baseline activity (computed using 0.5s or 1s prior to stimulus onset) for at least 10 out of the 44 time points (44.65 Hz frame rate * (0.5 s stimulus presentation + 0.5 s after stimulus offset).

To determine if a given cell showed a significant response at a particular stimulus configuration (size, speed, spatial frequency), we required that at least 2 out of the 8 directions at this given stimulus configuration evoked responses according to the above criteria. 

\textbf{\textit{Direction tuning curve fits}}

Direction tuning curves were estimated for each cell showing a significant response at a given stimulus configuration. 

Tuning curves were fitted with a two-peaked Gaussian with offset~\cite{somanypaper, alotofthem}:
EQUATION HERE
where R)(theta was the dF/F response for stimulus direction theta, etc.

First, in addition to the 8 tested points, a ninth point at 360 degrees was added, which was equal to the one at 0 degrees. The number of input points was increased from 9 to 25 by linear interpolation of the 9-point tuning curve. 

A bootstrap method was used to fit and estimate the tuning curve.  For each of 1000 iterations, the tuning curve was first computed by randomly sampling (with replacement) and averaging responses from 20 trials sampled from each of the 8 directions (to match the standard 20 repetitions in the actual experimental protocol). These 8-point tuning curves were interpolated, extended, then fit, as described above. The mean across the 10000 iterations were used as the final estimates of fitted parameters. 

To determine the quality of fits yielded by the above procedure, a combination of criteria was used [Liang, Cell 2018]~\cite{Liang2018cell}. For each iteration of the fitting procedure, a coefficient of determination, \textit{r}\textsuperscript{2}, was defined as the explained variance using least-squares regression to fit the data. Next, a combined coefficient of determination, \textit{r}\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{comb}, was computed by comparing the original tuning curve with the curve fit from the average of each fitting parameter across the 1000 iterations. A goodness-of-fit, \textit{G}\textit{\textsubscript{fit}}, was calculated as:

\textit{G}\textit{\textsubscript{fit}} = \bar{\sqrt{r\textsuperscript{2}}} (1 - IQR) \sqrt{r\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{comb}}

where IQR is the inter-quartile range (the difference between the 75\textsuperscript{th}- and 25\textsuperscript{th}-percentiles of $\surd$\textit{r}\textsuperscript{2}}  values across 1000 iterations). A cell was considered to have a well-fit tuning curve if the goodness-of-fit was greater than 0.60.  (more info on this).  The fitting procedure was performed separately for all stimulus configurations for which a cell was visually responsive, and the configuration yielding the maximum response was used.
